Kakurasu 

Rules 
•	Squares are either marked or not marked.
•	The clues are on the right and across the bottom and are the totals for the respective rows and columns. 
•	The numbers across the top and on the left are the values for each of the squares. 
•	Marking a square will add that square's value to both the row's total and the column's total. 


Ripple Effect

Rules
•	The area is divided by colour into Rooms. Fill in all empty cells with numbers under following rules.
•	Each Room contains consecutive numbers starting from 1, so a Room with four squares must contain 1,2,3, and 4.
•	If a number is duplicated in a row or a column, the space between the duplicated numbers must be equal or larger than the value of the number.
